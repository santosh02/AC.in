                  The thread is an independent path of execution. It's way to take advantage of multiple CPU available in a machine. By employing multiple threads you can speed up CPU bound task.
                </li>
                <li>Java provides excellent support for multithreading at the language level, and it's also one of the strong selling points.

              <p>Multithreading is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously. Its main advantage is: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Threads share the same address space.

                <li>Thread is lightweight. </li>

              <p>A process is a self contained execution environment and it can be seen as a program or application whereas Thread is a single task of execution within the process. Java runtime environment runs as a single process which contains different classes and programs as processes. Thread can be called lightweight process. Thread requires less resources to create and exists in the process, thread shares the process resources.</p>

              <p>This thread interview question is also ask as if start() method eventually call run() method then why do you need to call start() method, why not call run() method directly. well, reason is that because start method creates a new thread and call the code written inside the run method on a new thread while calling run method executes that code on the same thread.</p>

              <p>Java allows threads to access shared variables. As a rule, to ensure that shared variables are consistently updated, a thread should ensure that it has exclusive use of such variables by obtaining a lock that enforces mutual exclusion for those shared variables.</p>

              <p>Under preemptive scheduling, the highest priority task executes until it enters the waiting or dead states or a higher priority task comes into existence. Under time slicing, a task executes for a predefined slice of time and then reenters the pool of ready tasks. The scheduler then determines which task should execute next, based on priority and other factors.</p>

              <p>FutureTask represents a cancellable asynchronous computation in concurrent Java application. This class provides a base implementation of Future, with methods to start and cancel a computation, query to see if the computation is complete, and retrieve the result of the computation. The result can only be retrieved when the computation has completed; the get methods will block if the computation has not yet completed. A FutureTask object can be used to wrap a Callable or Runnable object. Since FutureTask also implements Runnable, it can be submitted to an Executor for execution.

            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>Main difference between interrupted() and isInterrupted() is that former clears the interrupt status while later does not. The interrupt mechanism in Java multi-threading is implemented using an internal flag known as the interrupt status. Interrupting a thread by calling Thread.interrupt() sets this flag. When interrupted thread checks for an interrupt by invoking the static method Thread.interrupted(), interrupt status is cleared. The non-static isInterrupted() method, which is used by one thread to query the interrupt status of another, does not change the interrupt status flag. By convention, any method that exits by throwing an InterruptedException clears interrupt status when it does so. However, it's always possible that interrupt status will immediately be set again, by another thread invoking interrupt</p>

                <li><strong>Waiting/Blocked/Sleeping</strong> - In these states the thread is alive but it's not in Runnable state. A running thread is called in these states after wait() or sleep() method is called that thread or when the thread is blocked while waiting for I/O resources.
