              <p>One of the most frequent behavioral questions to start up with the interview process in most of the giant MNC’s. You should give answer like this : Sir/Mam As much as I know myself, I am a confident individual who carries on with the task at hand without second thoughts . I have an immaculate zeal towards Learning and accepting newer ways of implementing things. As an Individual I tend to compete with myself setting my own goals adhering to Time Constraints with regard to the task assigned and this happens to be one of my biggest assets.</p>

              <p>I am proficient in Java (as an Application Development platform), well versed in Java Script (Front End Display), PL/SQL (accessing the DB). Java has been my forte but I am open towards any Programming Language as I focus upon Algorithms which is the baseline for providing the Programmatic design. This is another way of testing how a candidate would tune to such a question as part of the behavioral interview questions.</p>

              <p>Again, it is important to study the requirements of the position before you appear for the interview. List out your strengths and offer the ones that this role demands.</p>
              <p>For e.g. If you are appearing for the position of a Tech Lead – J2EE, talk about your J2EE skills, any extra knowledge which you have about coding with Frameworks in comparison to other candidates, your team management skills etc.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">

              <p>
                You have to be careful while answering this question. Do not offer a weakness which will directly affect your selection but at the same time saying that you do not have any weakness will not be right too. Every human being has weaknesses, so it is perfectly OK for you to have some too.</p>
                <p>The best way to answer this question will be to turn one of your strengths as a weakness and say that others accuse you of having this weakness but you think it is important to work in this manner. For e.g.: "My colleagues accuse me of paying to much attention to syntax but I believe it is important when you are writing the code to avoid spending too much time on finding and fixing the bugs later on."</p>

          <div id="collapse9" class="panel-collapse collapse fade">
            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>As part of popular behavioral questions and answers you would often find this one and to tell you frankly a lot of emphasis often is put upon this question. So the best way to handle this is first thing one must have profound knowledge of the organization in terms of its growth curve and salary growth in the recent times. So it can be tackled this way. Sir/Mam would you be kind enough to let me know what is the initiative taken that the existing employees are always taken care of and they seldom leave the organization!! How can I always manage to grow professionally keeping the balance between my Management and Technical Skills? What are the possibilities?</p>
